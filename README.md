# odin-recipes
I'm doing the Odin thing. And it just so happens that it ticks something I wanted to do for a bit. Archive my recipes.
By the end of this, I will have publicly demonstrated some basic-ass skills I've learned, such as basic HTML. This includes:

1- Making a boilerplate index.html file, specifying the doctype, putting in a html tag, specifying the language, head tag, body tag, all that stuff.

2- Putting a tiny bit of formatting into it using paragraph, heading, emphasis/italic and strong/bold tags.

3- Using links and making hypertext in html to lead to other pages.

4- Adding even more of a tiny bit of polish onto it by adding media such as img's, png's, jpg's or even gifs.

5- Making unordered and ordered lists.
